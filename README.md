# Christmas Card 2015

Every year, I make a web app as a kind of digital Christmas 'card' for my colleagues.

To see my previous Christmas cards, take a look at the [container project here](https://github.com/poshaughnessy/Merry-Christmas-From-Peter).

## Development

`npm install`

Then:

`npm start`

Load up: `http://localhost:9000`
