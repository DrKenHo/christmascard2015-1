# Christmas Card 2015

Every year, I make a web app as a kind of digital Christmas 'card' for my colleagues.

This year had to be Star Wars themed! Try it out in Chrome, Firefox or Safari on the desktop.
Don't forget to turn your sound up.

To see my previous Christmas cards, take a look at the [container project here](https://github.com/poshaughnessy/Merry-Christmas-From-Peter).
